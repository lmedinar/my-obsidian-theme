# Working on a first version
I want to have an Obsidian theme that updates everytime I use the wal command (pywal), which generates a color scheme for most of my other programs based on a wallpaper image.

# TODO
-[ ] Take basic colors for backgrounds and text.
-[ ] Adapt my pywal script to update the colors every time I run it.
-[ ] Include some extra changes according to types of text and pick their fonts.
